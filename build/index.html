    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <p> <em>Below are some legitimate, totally not randomly generated, user testimonials on how life changing this website was for them. </em></p>

    <p>If you hadn&#39;t visited this website today, you would have never known that August 24th is the day in 1662 that the Act of Uniformity requires England to accept the Book of Common Prayer. The more you know!</p>

    <p>Exposure to this website has changed me as a person, including my music tastes. I used to love listening to bow ukuleletech, but now I&#39;m a big fan of pulsing australian alternative and trance chileno.</p>

    <p>Kalju&#39;s website is all about self improvement. Before I found this website, I had lost my sense of self and was wasting my evenings away reading about Bernardo Piñol Jr.. Thanks to Kalju, I have gotten my life back on track and am in my second year of getting my PhD in Terminal 3 (song).</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Smells like a new car in here! The name's Kalju, pronounced: /call-you/, and welcome to my webpage 2.0! (What a disaster that first one was.) A basic HTML+CSS page didn't offer the amount of flexibility that I was after but I still enjoyed the simplicity of static pages. A solution to this was to rebuild it using the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty static site generator</a>. Highly recommend 11ty. Check it out if you haven't.</p>
<p>On the navbar on the left hand side of the page you'll find a tab called 'Life Events'. Pretty self-explanatory. Life is long, and I need a place to write things down before I forget them. Since I deleted my Facebook, this is now 'The Spot'. Zuckerberg's gonna have to try a little harder to get MY data.</p>
<p>The 'Testimonials' sidebar on the right is a collection of some random public APIs I found to add a little flavor to the page. I did some QA on each of them to make sure that nothing innapropriate would generate, but if you do see something innapropriate, its the API's fault!</p>
<p>In the 'Archives' section, I'll be periodically posting about the projects I'm currently working on. Same kind of thought process as 'Life Events' but the writing will be a little more technical.</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Class of 2021 University of Massachusetts - Amherst graduate. B.S in Mathematics with a double concentration in Applied Mathematics and Mathematical Computation. Mostly self-taught when it comes to development but I seem to be catching on a little bit. Web dev, while more visually rewarding in my opinion, has given me moments of pure grief and sorrow. React devs have my utmost respect for messing around with Javascript and Sass all day.</p>
<p>Back-end-wise, Docker is a beautiful piece of software written by beautiful people. It just works. Its magic. Microservices at your fingertips. Custom APIs? MySQL dbs? Say no more. Messing around with Kubernetes right now, we'll see where that leads.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, I'm always down for a good chess game! Hit me up on <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/kajaken">chess.com</a>! <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/tables">Premier League</a> also has consumed most of my life, but that's nothing new. I have learned to live with the curse.</p>
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p>My <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PYi69_zyZw8YguSrFjpw7iLiTzLJwzX6/view?usp=sharing">resume</a> contains my contact phone number and email.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalju-jake-nekvasil/">LinkedIn</a> page could use some work, but we'll tackle that soon.</p>
